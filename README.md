## vannya-mern-app [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vannya-mern-app.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/vannya-mern-app) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/vannya/vannya-mern-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/vannya/vannya-mern-app)

MERN app generator by [Van Tabbert](https://github.com/vannya).  
[NPM link](https://npmjs.com/package/vannya-mern-app)  

My personal generator for quick CRUD applications.  

Lots of the format is pulled from courses I have taken and merged together.
This generator does take a bit to load, but be patient and it could save you a bunch of setup time.  

If you'd like to use, please read all of the instructions before starting.

Requires npm 5.2+.  Make sure your node and npm are up to date!

## Data to collect before install

Please make sure that you have the following data for creation of the app:  
1. [Google+ API OAuth Client ID and Secret ID.](https://console.developers.google.com)
2. [MongoDB Atlas database created with database user added.](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) You'll need the URI code with your user and password inserted into it.  This will work with other Mongo DBs as long as you provide the URI.
3. [Heroku for deployment](https://www.heroku.com).  You'll need to add the config variables in your app at heroku.com.

## Installation

Run using `npx vannya-mern-app` and answering the questions for setup.  
Setup can take a while, especially at the Create-React-App step. Go get a drink and c'mon back! 

After install navigate to the new directory (your app name) and `npm start`!  
If you failed to provide the keys asked for during installation, you will need to update dev.js with the information before the application will run.
